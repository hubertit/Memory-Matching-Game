# Memory Matching Game

An interactive memory matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players flip cards to find matching pairs, aiming to match all pairs to win the game.

## Features

- **Card Flip**: Cards flip to reveal the hidden image when clicked.
- **Match Detection**: Checks for matching pairs. If a match is found, the cards remain face up; otherwise, they flip back after a short delay.
- **Win Condition**: Displays a "You Win!" message when all pairs are matched.
- **Restart Game**: A button to restart the game and shuffle the cards.
